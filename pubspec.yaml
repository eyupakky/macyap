  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # rules and activating additional ones.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/index.html
    - assets/test.png
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat-bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: Montserrat-italic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
    - family: Montserrat-normal
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
          style: normal

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
